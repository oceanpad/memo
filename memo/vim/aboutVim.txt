VIM REPLACE
:%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.

:s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.

:%s/foo/bar/gc
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.

:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.

:%s/foo/bar/gci
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
:%s/foo\c/bar/gc is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive.
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).
